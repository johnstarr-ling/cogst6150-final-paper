# cogst6150-final-paper
Materials for my final paper for the Fall 2023 iteration of COGST6150: Culture, Cognition, Humanities at Cornell University. The paper can be found above at: `starr-cogst6150-final-paper.pdf`

`exp1` contains all stimuli, code, and figures for the Experiment 1, barring one exception: code to generate is not linked here, but is currently being cleaned for another project `exp1rateshuman.png`. When such code is available to be released, I will link it here.

`exp2` contains all stimuli, code, and figures for Experiment 2.

The materials in this repository have not been optimized, but all code should run quickly.

*NOTE*: I use the OpenAI API to collect generations from GPT4 in both `exp1` and `exp2`. In order to run the code portions (besides plotting, which can be done without access to the OpenAI API), you must have your own OpenAI API key. Instructions on how to get an OpenAI API key can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python).
