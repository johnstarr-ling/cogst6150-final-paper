The passage is not a poem, as it lacks the key characteristics of a poem such as rhythm, rhyme, or metaphorical language. The passage is purely instructional and analytical in nature, explaining how to identify if a piece of text is a poem or not, making it closer to an analytical piece or an instruction manual rather than a poem."

OTHER (LINEBREAK),"After work, I drive back home\n feeling dead,\n only for the traffic signals to be yellow","Other

The passage, rather than employing rhythm, metaphor, or any other elements traditionally associated with poetry, has more of a conversational tone with straightforward syntax and structure.
